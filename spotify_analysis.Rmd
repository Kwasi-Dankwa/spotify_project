```{r}
# Load the dataset
spotify_data <- read.csv('spotify_top_music.csv')

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(spotify_data)

# Calculate total popularity of each artist
artist_popularity <- aggregate(pop ~ artist, data = spotify_data, sum)

# Sort by popularity in descending order
artist_popularity <- artist_popularity[order(-artist_popularity$pop), ]

# Display the top 10 most popular artists
artist_ten <- head(artist_popularity, 10)
```


```{r}
# Create bar plot to visualize top 10 artiste from 2010 to 2019

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5))

# Print the bar plot
print(barplot)
```
# The barplot shows us that beiber was the most popular star of the 2010s based on the total popularity of his music.

```{r}
# Calculate total popularity of each genre
genre_popularity <- aggregate(pop ~ top.genre, data = spotify_data, sum)

# Sort by popularity in descending order
genre_popularity <- genre_popularity[order(-genre_popularity$pop), ]

# Display the top 10 most popular genres
genre_ten <- head(genre_popularity, 10)

# Create bar plot for top 10 genres
barplot_genre <- ggplot(genre_ten, aes(x = reorder(top.genre, -pop), y = pop)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Popular Genres",
       x = "Genre",
       y = "Total Popularity") +

# Print the bar plot for top 10 genres

# The graph shows us that dance pop has heavily dominated the 2010s since its total popularity is way greater than the other genres combined.

```{r}
# Convert 'year' column to numeric data

# Group data by year and calculate mean for numeric variables
yearly_summary <- spotify_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(across(c(bpm, nrgy, dnce, dB, live, val, dur, acous, spch, pop), mean))

# Reshape data for plotting
yearly_summary_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(yearly_summary, cols = -year, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

# Plot time-series for data
time_series_plot <- ggplot(yearly_summary_long, aes(x = year, y = value, color = variable)) +

# The time series can give any upcoming artist specific insights on how to 'hack the algorithm' and become popular.

# Over the years we've seen songs have a high tendency to be acoustic while the bpm of songs have seen a steady decline.The enrgy and duration of songs have also declined over time during the 2010s as well.

# However throughout the years we,ve seen most songs have a higher danceability which can be correlated with the popularity. Speechiness of songs have had peaks and valleys over the years. It can also be noted that the number of artistes producing positive sounding songs(valence) has decreased over the years.



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
