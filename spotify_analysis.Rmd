This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
```


```{r}
# Load the dataset
spotify_data <- read.csv('spotify_top_music.csv')

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(spotify_data)

# Calculate total popularity of each artist
artist_popularity <- aggregate(pop ~ artist, data = spotify_data, sum)

# Sort by popularity in descending order
artist_popularity <- artist_popularity[order(-artist_popularity$pop), ]

# Display the top 10 most popular artists
artist_ten <- head(artist_popularity, 10)

# Create bar plot to visualize top 10 artiste from 2010 to 2019
barplot <- ggplot(artist_ten, aes(x = reorder(artist, -pop), y = pop)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Popular Artists",
       x = "Artist",
       y = "Total Popularity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.5))

# Print the bar plot
print(barplot)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
