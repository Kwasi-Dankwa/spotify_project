# spotify_project
This is a spotify data project to practice my data analysis and viz skills.
This dataset consists of ~600 songs that were in the top songs of the year from 2010 to 2019 (as measured by Billboard). 
You can explore interesting song data pulled from Spotify such as the beats per minute, amount of spoken words, loudness, and energy of every song.

**Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:**

- üó∫Ô∏è **Explore**: Which artists and genres are the most popular?
- I was able to tackle this issue by aggregating calculating the total popularity of each artist and genre and creating a barplot to visualize the top 10.
- üìä **Visualize**: Visualize the numeric values as a time-series by year. Can you spot any changes over the years?
- I visualized the numeric values as a time-series by year to spot any changes and trends over the years, as the years went by. This was done by aggregating data by year
- After I created a line plot for each numberic variables over the years to visualize these trends.
 
- üîé **Analyze**: I plan to expand on this project over time to by training and building a classifier to predict a song's genre based on specific columns.
